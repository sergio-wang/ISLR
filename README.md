## Introduction and Disclaimer

This repository was created with the objective of centralizing all the exercises and labs from the book ```Introduction to Statistical Learning (v1)```
without the intention of claiming any of the documentation as my own intellectual property. 

If anything, I support the acquisition of the book or the PDF which can be found online (just google it) [link to their website](https://www.statlearning.com/)

## Message for future me

A lot of the texts and codes were re-written to make it simpler for my understanding in a quick read. If necessary, all of the topics will be 
separated in adequate folders
